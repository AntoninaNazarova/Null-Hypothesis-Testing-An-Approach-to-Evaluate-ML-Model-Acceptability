9)	To finalize the selection of the Clearance benchmark from TDC, we downloaded the filtered set of 342 compounds in TSV format (only .csv and .tsv formats were available for download). We then performed a deduplication step by calculating the number of structurally duplicated compounds. This analysis revealed 160 duplicates. One compound (entry #20) contained an unrecognized charge state, which we manually corrected.
As a result, the final curated set consisted of 182 unique approved drug compounds with reported clearance values, as summarized in Table 1 of the manuscript. For transparency and reproducibility—and in response to the reviewer’s request—we provide a Jupyter Notebook script that converts the .tsv file to an .sdf file, allowing all structures, including duplicates, to be visualized in any standard molecular modeling software
